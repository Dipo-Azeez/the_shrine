   <h2>  Daily Schedule & Services Provided </h2>
    
    <p style="color: red;"> Daily Schedule • Retreats • Tours • Disabled Visitors • Restrooms • Food • Special Requests </p>
    
     
    
    <h2> Daily Schedule </h2>
<p> Every day, the Shrine offers Masses, Confessions and a Holy Hour, as well as a Rosary for Life and the Chaplet of The Divine Mercy. </p>
    
<p> Please see the Schedule Section of the website for the Monthly Schedule of Special Events as well as the Daily Schedule of services and devotions. </p>
    
<p> NOTE: As our Shrine Church is small, and we want to welcome as many pilgrims as possible to join us in celebration of God’s Mercy, there are days when our Masses and devotions are moved outside. These decisions are made on the day in question, and are not announced in advance. Please come prepared for weather, in case many others join you on Eden Hill that day! </p>
    
     
    
  <h2>   Retreats </h2>
   <p> We are asked a lot about “joining a retreat here on Eden Hill.” Although we have very few events that we label “Retreats” (they would be listed as a “special event” on the Monthly Calendar), that is because every day here on Eden Hill at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy is a mini-Retreat! </p> 
    
   <p>  Our beautiful Shrine Church, at least two Masses, Confessions, a Holy Hour, the Holy Rosary, Life-Sized Stations of The Cross, a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes, many mini-Shrines, and our Oratory Chapel are all available for prayer and meditation every day. Each pilgrim can customize their own personal retreat. </p> 
    
     
    
<h2> Tours </h2>
<p>    We unfortunately do not have enough volunteers, staff, or seminarians on Eden Hill to offer regularly scheduled tours, or tours for groups, large or small. </p> 
    
<p>    We have maps of the property, and a brochure on the history of the Shrine Church itself, to enable people to give themselves “self-guided” tours. </p> 
    
     
    
<h2> Disabled Visitors </h2>
  <b> PARKING: </b>  
<p>  Our parking Lot is about ¼ mile from the Shrine Church. We ask those not in need of assistance to please park in the main lot and walk up to the church/outdoor altar, as our handicapped spaces are limited. </p> 
    
<p>   We have handicapped parking spots right at the Shrine Church entrance, at the entrance to the Outdoor Altar, and at the Gift Shop, for pilgrims with special needs. We also have elongated golf carts (“jitneys”) on weekends and on days on which we have bus groups, to help the handicapped, whenever available. </p> 
    
<p>   Please see the special section with regard to DIVINE MERCY WEEKEND and our special HERITAGE DAYS (Encuentro Latino, Filipino Day, Vietnamese Day, and Polish Day), as we have no handicapped assistance available on those days. </p> 
    
<b> BUILDING ACCESS: </b> 
<p>    The Gift Shop, restrooms, and St. Faustina Center all have handicapped entrances and/or ramps. </p> 
    
<p>   The Shrine Church is entered by climbing a flight of stairs, and does not have a ramp. There is an elevator up to the Shrine Church level, and down to the level with the restrooms. The elevator is accessed by entering through the Shrine Reception Area, behind the statue of St John Paul II, just to the left of the Shrine main entrance. </p> 
    
<p>   Outdoor Masses are on a natural amphitheater/sloping lawn behind the Shrine Church, at our Mother of Mercy Outdoor Shrine. Those who cannot negotiate the hill are allowed to sit in the wings of the outdoor altar or at the top of the hill, OUTSIDE the gated terrace area, and Communion WILL be brought to them. </p> 
    
<p>   On Divine Mercy Sunday weekend, the wings of the outdoor altar are not available, but Handicapped individuals are allowed to sit at the top of the hill, and Communion will be brought to them. Only one person may sit with a handicapped person. </p> 
    
     
    
   <h2> Restrooms </h2> 
<p>     Please note that the restrooms in the Shrine Church basement close at 5 p.m., when the offices close; and the restrooms in the parking lot close at 5 p.m. Monday – Friday and at 6 p.m. on the weekends. </p> 
    
     
    
<h2> Food </h2>
<p>    We have no food services or restaurant on Eden Hill, but we do offer picnic tables from May through October, where we invite you to eat whatever you have brought. Please do not bring grills or any other source of fire. </p> 
    
<p>    You are welcome to bring your own food, or you may have food delivered via Instacart, or by a local caterer or restaurant. They are all used to delivering food to our picnic tents! Please be sure to tip in advance, if you will not be there to accept the order; and to have someone in your group check that your food was delivered far enough in advance of your meal so you can trouble-shoot, if there is a problem with your order. It is rare, but it does happen.</p> 
    
<p>    As we have a lot of wildlife, we ask that you please pick up any trash you have and place it in a trash receptacle that has room for it. If the nearby bin is full, please let our staff know, so that we can assist you by emptying the full bins! </p> 
    
<p>    For more information about our local towns, please see the listing of the local Chamber of Commerce sites.</p> 
    
     
    
<h2> Special Requests </h2>
<p>    We try to provide a full schedule to allow our pilgrims to join with us as a community of faith in celebrating God’s infinite Mercy. </p> 
    
<p>    With limited facilities and staff, we cannot always accommodate the special functions that groups request, but we try our hardest to make each day special and holy for every pilgrim and group who comes to join us in celebrating God’s unending Mercy.</p> 
    
<p>   Feel free to ask for what you need, or would like; and please understand that we will do our best, even if we cannot accommodate you in the exact manner you were thinking. The more advance notice we have, the better chance we have of making something work, and we appreciate your flexibility as we try to fulfill your needs, while ensuring that everyone who comes that day has a blessed day full of grace.</p>
